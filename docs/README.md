# Project Redesign Notes

This folder collects the architecture plans, milestone updates, and running
devlog for the rebuild of the Bloch sphere visualizer into a full web
application (React + TypeScript front end, FastAPI + Qiskit backend).

Be diligent about updating the devlog after *every* significant action so we
retain the full context even if conversation history is truncated.

Key files:

- `project_plan.md` – milestones, guiding principles, next actions.
- `devlog.md` – chronological updates.
- `ux_wireframe.md` – textual description of the intended layout before formal
  design artifacts.
